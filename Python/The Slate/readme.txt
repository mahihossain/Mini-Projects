The slate is primarily a python based self development project. The idea is to creat an app that will keep track of everything that a person want or do not want about him/herself and through the process face and know thyself. The name "The Slate" refers to "You can change your habits like you can erase the writings on a slate and rewrite them". The initial name is this. Lets see what future holds.
